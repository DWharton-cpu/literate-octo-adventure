				 I am a UX and UI designer. I want to build websites and apps. I am currently studying HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I intend to work with a company providing  web and app services to clients. On this page you'll find a mini project I am working on. I like finding the truth and sometimes I share a story. My Github repository suggested the name "literate-octo-adventure" and I love octopus so I went with it. It's about nature and advanced technology. Below is my current progress, and a related design strategy.<br><br>

        <ul>
          <li>Small efforts applied wisely really make a difference. I wanted to renew the way I express myself.  </li>
          <li>Stay focused on purpose. Don't try to fill it to the brim. </li>
          <li>Focus on useful connections you made, not how many connections in total. </li>

        <h3>Prepare to Achieve</h3>
        <p>
          I forgot about how I would change after I finished the drawings and the design. Savages know no bounds and I am one of them.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>I gave up explaining why "it worked" and focused on the purpose. </li>
          <li>I did not care who saw, and I definitely laughed off any questioning. </li>
          <li>I was tired of "looking elegant" without substance in my layouts. </li>
          <li>I kept it simple - half the time a "ceiling" is irrelevant.</li>
